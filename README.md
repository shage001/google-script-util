# google-script-util
A util library for google scripts.
## How to use:
Google script libraries cause a performance hit, so our convention has been to include a 'util.gs' file in every project. Whenever you make a project and want access to these functions just copy the latest version of 'main.build.js' and add your project name to projects.txt.
